100x is a collection of packages for building interactive web applications. It includes the core `@100x/engine` package,
which provides fundamental building blocks including an integration with Three.js. The `@100x/application` package is a build cli
for building full-stack web applications, and the `@100x/router` and `@100x/react` packages combine to create a React-based full stack framework.
